# OPT_IN and OPT_OUT Triggers

## Overview

The `OPT_IN` and `OPT_OUT` triggers fire when a contact opts in or out of messaging through channel-specific mechanisms. These triggers are only supported on select channels that have native opt-in/opt-out functionality (primarily Viber Business Messages).

**Important:** These triggers are NOT fired for SMS STOP keywords or similar text-based opt-out mechanisms. SMS opt-outs are handled through `MESSAGE_INBOUND`.

## When They Fire

### OPT_IN

- Contact clicks "Follow" or "Subscribe" button in a Viber Business Messages conversation
- Contact opts in via channel-specific UI elements (channel-dependent)
- Only on channels that support native opt-in mechanisms

### OPT_OUT

- Contact clicks "Unfollow" or "Unsubscribe" button in a Viber Business Messages conversation
- Contact opts out via channel-specific UI elements (channel-dependent)
- Only on channels that support native opt-out mechanisms

### NOT Triggered By

- SMS "STOP" keywords (handled as `MESSAGE_INBOUND` text message)
- Email unsubscribe links (not part of Conversation API)
- Manual opt-out status changes via API
- WhatsApp block/unblock actions

**Note:** Channel support may expand in the future. Check Sinch documentation for current channel support.

## Common Use Cases

1. **Compliance Management** — Update subscription status when contacts opt in/out via channel UI
2. **CRM Synchronization** — Sync opt-in/opt-out status with external CRM or marketing platforms
3. **Suppression Lists** — Add opted-out contacts to suppression lists to prevent future messaging
4. **Permission Tracking** — Maintain audit trail of consent changes for GDPR/TCPA compliance
5. **Re-engagement Prevention** — Prevent sending marketing messages to opted-out contacts
6. **Channel Preference Updates** — Update contact's preferred communication channels based on opt status

## Example Callback Payloads

### Opt-In

```json
{
  "app_id": "01H1234567...",
  "accepted_time": "2024-06-15T14:30:00.123Z",
  "event_time": "2024-06-15T14:29:59.890Z",
  "project_id": "PROJECT123",
  "opt_in_notification": {
    "contact_id": "01H3333333...",
    "channel": "VIBER",
    "identity": "46732001122",
    "status": "OPT_IN_SUCCEEDED"
  }
}
```

Opt-out uses the same structure with `opt_out_notification` and `OPT_OUT_SUCCEEDED`.

## Handling SMS Opt-Outs (Not Via These Triggers)

SMS opt-outs are handled through `MESSAGE_INBOUND` when a contact replies with keywords like "STOP", "UNSUBSCRIBE", "END". You must detect these in your webhook handler and update your suppression list.

## Key Points

1. **Limited Channel Support** — Currently only Viber Business Messages reliably supports these triggers; most channels don't
2. **Not for SMS STOP** — SMS opt-outs (STOP keywords) are delivered as regular `MESSAGE_INBOUND` messages, not via these triggers
3. **Channel-Specific UI** — These triggers only fire for native channel UI actions (buttons, settings menus), not text-based commands
4. **Always Succeeded** — Both triggers only report `OPT_IN_SUCCEEDED` and `OPT_OUT_SUCCEEDED`; there's no failed status
5. **Compliance Requirement** — Must honor opt-out requests immediately; failing to do so violates regulations (GDPR, TCPA, etc.)
6. **Bidirectional** — Contacts can opt in and out multiple times; implement proper state management
7. **Contact Identification** — Use `contact_id` to identify who opted in/out; `identity` shows the channel-specific identifier
8. **No Automatic Enforcement** — Conversation API does not automatically prevent sending to opted-out contacts; you must implement this logic
9. **Audit Trail** — Log all opt-in/opt-out events with timestamps for compliance audits
10. **External System Sync** — Update all external systems (CRM, marketing platforms, databases) when opt status changes
11. **WhatsApp Blocks** — WhatsApp blocks/reports are handled separately and don't fire these triggers; monitor delivery reports for WhatsApp policy violations instead
